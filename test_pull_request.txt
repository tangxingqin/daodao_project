test
1. use 'fix #xxx' will close issue automatically, no new issue will be created.

2. use 'refs' won't close the issue, need create pull request manually, but new pull request will create a new issue.

3. one branch seems can be created only one pull request if using 'hub pull request'

4. create pull request based on master branch on existing issue #4:
   hub pull-request -i 4

5. hub pull-request -i 5 -b create-pull-request-existing-issue
